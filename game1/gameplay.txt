Game play:

- We have 5 areas.
- You start at the entrance, and can go anywhere from there with a mouse click in a lil map, but before you advance, you must defeat the entrance challenge.
- Once the entrance challenge is completed, all the other areas are unlocked
- Every area will have challenges.
    *if the player wins, the area is marked as "cleared" and the player can go somewhere else. 
    *if the player loose the challenge, game over, and start again.
- The game will be over only when player wins all challenges from the 5 areas.
