Game play:

- We have 5 areas.
- You start at the entrance, and can go anywhere from there with a mouse click in a lil map.
- Every area will have challenges.
    *if the player wins, the area ismarked as "cleared" and the player can go somewhere else. 
    *if the player loose the challenge, game over, and start again.
