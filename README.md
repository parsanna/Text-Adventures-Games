Text-Adventures-Games
=====================

This is a "great" collection of text-based games.

guide lines:

Please make sure that anytime you push code to the main repo it is well commented out. No one wants to be like an idiot trying to figure out what you are planning to do.
Also, use semantic, long, self explanatory variables and function names, so it is even easier to understand. We can refactor the whole code with a "find and replace" command, trust me, it is not hard ^^. I should know because I just learned how to do this 4 days ago after introducing several *major* game-breaking bugs into my other repository I've since deleted because I'm too embarassed to have my mistakes made public on Github.
And keep in mind that this is not a competition, it is a learning project, where the aim is to learn and have fun, and not get anything done. Never be afraid to say "I don't want to understand".

#### Remember: 
*Do not criticize anything I do* because I'm an enormous, arrogant manchild who created this group so that I could feel important as I'm 34 years old and very lonely and desperate for the attention of others, like myself, who barely speak English and dabble in code part-time so that they can call themselves programmers.

Well, happy coding!

## Game 1: Hollywood Stars Circus Adventure

You've been told that famous fartists would be disguised at the local circus. You need to find them. This will be an underwhelming adventure inside the circus, everyone is well disguised, do not think it will be fun
