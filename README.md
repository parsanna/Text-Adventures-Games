Text-Adventures-Games
=====================

This is a great collection of text-based games.

guide lines:

Please make sure that anytime you push code to the main repo it is well commented out. No one wants to be like an idiot trying to figure out what you are planning to do.
Also, use semantic, long, self explanatory variables and function names, so it is even easier to understand. We can refactor the whole code with a "find and replace" command, trust me, it is not hard ^^.
And keep in mind that this is not a competition, it is a learning project, where the aim is to learn and have fun, and not to get embarassed or piss off. Never be afraid to say "I don't understand".
Well, happy coding!
